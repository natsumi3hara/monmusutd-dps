# monmusutd-dps
## General
This project was originally started as a DPS calculator for the browser game Monster Musume Tower Defense (MTD)
However, due to the complexity of the equations, other tools started first.

## Currently available tools
* [Characters (WIP)](#characters)
* [Drops](#drops)

## Drops
https://natsumi3hara.github.io/monmusutd-dps/drops/

**How to use**

Click on an item to show the drop info for that item.

The stamina efficiency is automatically calculated for each stage. Currently available quests will be shown on top of unavailable ones.

The highest stage on the "Available" list will be shown as the best stage to farm.

Please refer to the event names via the Fandom wiki here: https://monmusutd.fandom.com/wiki/Event_Quests

## Characters (WIP)
Currently has links to each monmusu for race trait and skill data. Skill data is a bit weird. Unknown if will be continued.
